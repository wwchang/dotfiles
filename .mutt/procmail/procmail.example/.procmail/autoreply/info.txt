Hello,

Thanks for requesting our information.

EREHWON is the name of our private conversation room 'PATIO' on
NIFTY-SERVE which is a commercial BBS in Japan.
The meaning of the word 'EREHWON' is almost same as "Utopia".
    -- yeah, just a reverse spelling. :-)

We have a web site as the place of our works to dispatch.
We also have an anonymous FTP site where are many freeware and shareware
for the convenience of Mac users.


If you would like to know more, please E-mail to the below address or
visit our web site at <http://www.erehwon.org/>.


Thank you again!
