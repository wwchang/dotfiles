# IMAP locations can be accessed in the same sort of web-browser style as POP3 mailboxes:
# imap://hostname/mailbox
#where hostname is the name of your IMAP server, and mailbox is the name of your mailbox on the server. All IMAP servers provide one special
#folder called INBOX, which is where your incoming mail normally arrives. For example, if your IMAP server is mailhost.mydomain.com, you could
#open your INBOX there by telling mutt to open imap://mailhost.mydomain.com/INBOX
# imap[s]://[user@]hostname[:port]/mailbox
# imap://username@mail.example.com/
# imaps://username@mail.example.com/


# How you write the actually mailbox name may depend on your IMAP server. First, some servers will put all of your mail into a subfolder, often
# a subfolder of INBOX. For instance, if your server is Courier or Cyrus, your folder Lists may actually be INBOX.Lists. This brings us to point
# number two: some servers don't use '/' to separate folder names. The reference server (UW-IMAP) uses '/', but two common servers (Courier and
# Cyrus) both generally use '.', and Lotus Notes has a server which uses '\' (a very bad choice, by the way). Generally you can use '/' and mutt
# will figure out what to do with it, though. Some examples:
# imap://hostname/lists/mutt-dev 
# imap://hostname/INBOX.lists.mutt-dev
# You can access individual folders in your account by using '/' as a path separator:
# imap://username@mail.example.com/path/to/mailbox/

# 1.2. Connecting to your IMAP server
# To connect to your IMAP server, just switch to an IMAP mailbox. That is, press c to get the Open mailbox: prompt, and enter an IMAP mailbox as
# described above. You'll need your IMAP user name and password. You may set these in advance via configuration the variables imap_user and
# imap_pass. If you haven't set them, mutt will prompt you for this information when you first connect to your server.

# 1.3. Using an IMAP server instead of local mail
# Tell mutt to use your IMAP INBOX as your $spoolfile: set spoolfile=imap://hostname/INBOX
# Set your $folder to your IMAP root: set folder=imap://hostname/
#1.3.1. Polling for new mail
# This works the same as normal mail, with a couple of caveats. You add mailboxes you'd like to check for mail using the mailboxes command. If you've
# set your folder as above, you can do
# mailboxes =lists/mutt-dev =lists/mutt-users
# to poll for mail in imap://hostname/lists/mutt-dev and imap://hostname/lists/mutt-users.
# The caveats:
# Mutt will scan for new mail in all of your mailboxes every mail_check seconds. The default is 5 seconds, which will make mutt feel very
# sluggish if you have more than a couple of mailboxes defined. You'll like mutt better if you increase this to at least 60.  Mutt checks for mail
# in the current IMAP mailbox no more ofter than timeout seconds. The default is 600, which means you will only get notified about new mail in your
# current mailbox every 10 minutes. You may wish to lower this to something like 15.
