# Usage: mbox-hook [!]pattern mailbox
# 
# This command is used to move read messages from a specified mailbox to a different mailbox
# automatically when you quit or change folders. Pattern is a regular expression specifying the
# mailbox to treat as a ``spool"" mailbox and mailbox specifies where mail should be saved when
# read.
# 
# Unlike some of the other hook commands, only the first matching pattern is used (it is not
# possible to save read mail in more than a single mailbox).
