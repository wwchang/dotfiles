Sarah Terenzi, better known as Sarah Connor (born June 13, 1980) is a German pop music singer who has enjoyed a great deal of success in the European pop charts since the early 2000s. Sarah was married to former boy band star Marc Terenzi and has a son named Tyler. On June 23rd daughter Summer Antonia Soraya was born.

Rapper TQ produced Sarah's first single "Let's Get Back To Bed - Boy" which went to the top 5 in Germany and Austria, top 10 in Switzerland and top 20 in the UK in spring/summer 2001, followed up by the Blackstreet sampling single "French Kissing". The third track, "From Sarah With Love", even overtopped the success of the previous singles and went straight to the charts' top in Germany, Switzerland and several other European countries, eventually selling over 750,000 copies. Afterwards Sarah released her debut album, Green Eyed Soul, which sold 450,000 records domestically and peaked at #2 in Germany, also reaching the top 10 in Finland, Greece, Poland, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal. In the meantime Connor won a Comet and an ECHO for "Female National Rock/Pop Artist".

Connor's sophomore album Unbelievable was released in 2002 in Europe. Wyclef Jean wrote, produced and rapped on the CD's first single, "One Nite Stand (Of Wolves And Sheep)", which once again entered the top 5. Unbelievable simultaneously became another smash, achieving gold status in Germany within 48 hours. With the Diane Warren written ballad "Skin On Skin", "It's Unbelievable" and "Bounce" the album spawned further three singles.

In spite of being heavily pregnant with her first child then, Sarah decided to release her third album called Key To My Soul in November 2003. However, the album's first single, "Music Is The Key", featuring New York a capella singers Naturally 7 managed to become her second #1 in Germany. "Just One Last Dance", the next and final single (due to the birth of her son Tyler around this time), was a re-recorded edition of the album's original version, including new vocals by Marc Terenzi's band "Natural". The duet once again reached #1 in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and the top 20 on a composite World Top 40.

In the fall of 2003 some American DJs got a hold of Sarah's previous hit 'Bounce'. Soon 'Bounce' was getting heavy radio airplay and Sony Records wanted to release a CD of her songs to the US music scene. Sarah was about 6 months pregnant when 'Bounce' started hitting the singles charts (it peaked in the top 40) so she wasn't able to promote. A compilation of her previous 3 albums singles titled 'Sarah Connor' was released in the Winter of 2004, a few weeks before her son Tyler was born. 'Sarah Connor' debuted at #112 on the album charts and never climbed again due to lack of promotion.

after the sucsess in europe and the usa sarah connors people relesed the sarah connor album and bounce single in the uk, bounce hit number 14 on the top 20 and she performed on top of the pops and gay, the track was hitlisted on capital fm and kiss.

the single bounce also hit number 1 in austalia.

In fall 2004 Sarah returned with "Living To Love You", which peaked at #1 in Germany and Switzerland. In March 2005 she contributed the soundtrack to the computer-animated movie Robots with her single "From Zero To Hero", her fifth #1 single in Germany and the fourth #1 in a row.

In the Summer of 2005 Sarah and her husband Marc starred in their own "reality show" 'Sarah and Marc in love'. The series (no matter how cheesy some fans felt it was) was a smash hit and helped relaunch Sarah's diva status and made Marc Terenzi (now a solo artist) a known name. The series was a one off type "documentary" that led up to Sarah and Marc's rewedding in Spain at the end of July. Marc had recorded a song for Sarah called "Love to be loved by you", which became an instant hit.

In December 2005 as she toured to support 'Naughty but Nice' Sarah released a Christmas album called 'Christmas in my heart'. The same titled single went to #4 in the charts and the album reached the top 10. 'Christmas in my heart' wasn't your typical Christmas album: Sarah put a jazzy spin on old favorites and remade German language Christmas tunes (the tracks 'Be Thankful', 'Sweet is the song', and 'Tonights the night') in English.

Their second child, a daughter called Summer Antonia Soraya (second and third name coming from her grandmothers) was born. She was born with a hole in her heart.
