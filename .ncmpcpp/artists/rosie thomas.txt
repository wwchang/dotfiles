Rosie Thomas is an American singer-songwriter from Seattle.

She toured with the band Velour 100 in the late 1990s before deciding to go solo.

Her appearance on the song "Parking Lot", from Damien Jurado's album Ghost of David, brought her to the attention of famed record label Sub Pop who signed her in 2000.

Her debut album When We Were Small was released on 22 January 2001. The album featured Eric Fisher (who Thomas met at performance art school in Seattle) on guitar and keyboards and Andy Myers on drums.

Fisher and Myers returned for 2003's follow-up Only With Laughter Can You Win.

Thomas released her third album, If Songs Could Be Held, in 2005.

Her fourth album These Friends of Mine, was recorded in collaboration with Sufjan Stevens who plays guitar and banjo as well as providing some vocals, and Denison Witmer. 

Thomas also performs as a stand-up comedian under the name Sheila Saputo.
