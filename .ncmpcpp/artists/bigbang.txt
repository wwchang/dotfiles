Bigbang have been dubbed Norway’s Greatest Live Band, and have been a major force in the Norwegian music scene for over a decade. During the past two years, the band has spent time focusing on the American market. Based in California, they have toured the country, playing intimate gigs and promoting their American debut From Acid to Zen, a compilation of songs from previously released albums. The album was very well received and resulted in great reviews among others from Rolling Stone Magazine’s Editor David Fricke: It’s a shotgun buffet, like those early U.S. LPs by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones that combined album tracks and singles from unrelated sessions, and it succeeds the same way: like an instant greatest-hits record. Singer-guitarist-songwriter &Oslash;ystein Greni has the right history in his genes — his dad sang in a Norwegian band that opened for Led Zeppelin in 1968 — and he grounds songs like “Early December,” “Hurricane Boy” and the brilliantly titled “From Acid to Zen” in the eternal power-chord charge and fish-hook riffs of the Stones and the Who. But Greni also has a knack for wringing fresh excitement from the familiar: the country-angel harmonies and ice-Byrds guitar in the new version of “Wild Bird,” the improbable dream of Badfinger and Hüsker Dü in “The One.” – David Fricke, Rolling Stone Magazine Edendale was recorded in the legendary Sound City Studios, with an impressive list of collaborators: Producers: Øystein Greni and Greg Richling (Wallflowers) Technician/mixer: Bryan Cook (Damian Rice, Jackson Browne, Stevie Nicks, Elton John etc) Mastered by: Gavin Lurssen (Robert Plant/Alison Krauss, Tom Waits, Elvis Costello) Guest guitarists: David Rawlings (Ryan Adams, Gillian Welch), Jared Nelson Smith (Hello Stranger) Release date in Norway: 9th of March Other territories: summer/autumn 2009
