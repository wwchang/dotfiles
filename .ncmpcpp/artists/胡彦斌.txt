Anson was born and grew up in Shanghai. Since he was in elementary school, he has been learning to pop songs and sings along with them every day. He began studying singing at a local performing arts school when he was just 13. At the age of 15, he made a wish that he could release an album before he was 18. Fortunately, his dream came true. In 2002 Hu's first album came out and he became the youngest mainland singer to release an album. There are ten songs in the album. Those songs show the 18-year-old boy's good understanding of music.T he album quickly got popular, so did Hu himself. Some people think that Hu's musical style is like Jay Chou, the super pop star from Taiwan. But Hu doesn't think so. He said his musical style was quite different, even though he liked Jay Chou'music very much. He has been trying to have different changes in his musical style and bring out more and better songs for his fans.
