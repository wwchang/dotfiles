Lenka is a mononym of  at least two artists: 1) Australia's Lenka Kripac. 2) A Pittsburgh, PA, USA's Lenka Clayton.

1) Lenka Kripac (b. 1978), is a television actress - turned ensemble musician, with Decoder Ring - later, turned solo singer-songwriter in 2008. Most famous worldwide for her song The Show, which has been used in numerous advertisements, most notably for Old Navy.

Her vocal stylings offer a juxtaposition of catchy pop and layered, complicated world music influences. This juxtaposing is of late current in the popular music, spreading through the internet. Similar layering exists in the music of the anti-folk Russian-born New York City-based musician Regina Spektor, or the French/Israeli/Tunesian tri-language singer-songwriter Ya&euml;l Na&iuml;m (aka Yael Naim), or the eclectic Italian violinist / mandolinist Alessandro Monti. Lenka's eponymous album is the latest salvo in this ongoing process.

She was previously best known as the third host of a long-running childrens' breakfast cartoon program Cheez TV in Australia, and has appeared in numerous Australian television serials.

She was born in New South Wales, Australia but now lives in Brooklyn, New York. She has ancestors in the Czech Republic.

2) Lenka Clayton is a Pittsburgh, PA, USA artist, who released "Qaeda, Quality, Question, Quickly, Quickly, Quiet" (2004, Accidental Records) & contributed field recordings to Matthew Herbert's "Plat du Jour" (2005, Accidental Records).
