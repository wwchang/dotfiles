Both the band members, Lu Gengxu and Miao Jie, are graduates of China’s top university, Tsing Hua. Despite their non-musical education, Age of Water and Wood (水木年华) has managed to garner thousands of fans as well as numerous music awards with their harmonious duets, fluent melodies and sentimental memories of campus (their 2004 album, Autograph Book of Graduation). As the members’ college years are long behind them, the duo has outgrown its original sound. In their two most recent albums, they succeeded in forging a new style - a dramatic, elegant rock sound - without losing their original appeal.
