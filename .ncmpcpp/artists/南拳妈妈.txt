Nan Quan Mama (traditional Chinese: 南拳媽媽; simplified Chinese: 南拳妈妈; pinyin: Nán Quán Māmā) is Taiwanese music group. The name means "southfist mother," which is a phrase in Chinese to explain having strength while being gentle as a mother. They are closely tied with the popular music artist Jay Chou.

The members are Lara Veronin (vocalist), Devon (drummer, DJ, rapper), Yuhao (pianist, rapper) and Chase (Zhang Jie) (guitarist, singer). Each of the members contribute to composing their songs, and also sing together in most of their songs, although some of their songs are composed and sung solely by one of the members, such as the song "Crystal Dragonfly" (水晶蜻蜓) which was composed and sung by Lara. As of June 2006, they are the official spokespeople for Motorola in Taiwan.
