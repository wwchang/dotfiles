1.  After School (애프터스쿨) is an eight member South Korean female musical group formed in 2009. They are managed by Pledis Entertainment, the same management company of singer 손담비. After School originally debuted with five members on January 17, 2009 with their first dance song, AH.

Park Kahi, After School's leader, had been as a back-up dancer for artists under both SM Entertainment and YG Entertainment, most notably for Boa. She has also been a trainee under JYP Entertainment. Kahi was part of a Korean-American girl group called S. Blush, whose first digital single peaked at #2 at the Billboard Hot Dance Chart. In 2008, Kahi was featured in 손담비's Bad Boy music video as a rapper, and Kim Jung Ah took part in Son Dambi's performances as a back-up dancer as part of her training. 

Days before After School's debut, Pledis Entertainment officially announced that the group's music concept is heavily influenced by the Pussycat Dolls, and that they "will be a type of group that Korea has never seen before". On January 15, 2009, Pledis Entertainment released a 30-second teaser music video for AH to the web, which reached 10,000  views on the first day. The girls, as a group, made an unofficial first appearance on December 29, 2008 at the SBS Song Festival 'S', performing Play Girlz with Son Dambi.

After School's debut single AH was released with their first EP, "New Schoolgirl," on January 15, 2009. They made their debut performance on January 17, 2009 on MBC's music program, Show! Music Core.

In April 2009, it was announced by Pledis Entertainment that UEE (유이, real name Kim Yoo Jin) would be joining After School as a sixth member. She was first introduced to the public as a friend of Wonder Girls member Kim Yoobin on the television program "Introducing a Star's Friend," where they revealed that they were initially part of a five member girl group with Good Entertainment that was eventually disbanded due to financial reasons.

Their second single is Diva, an upbeat dance song. The track was released as their first digital single. Promotional activities began April 9, 2009, with their comeback performance on MNet's M! Countdown.

On May 21, 2009, After School released a cover of morning musume's LOVE Machine, titled Dream Girl.

Later on, it was announced that After School would collaborate with the popular Pledis artist 손담비. The digital single Amoled was released on July 23, 2009 as part of promotions for Samsung's phone, "Amoled".

On October 29, 2009, Yoo So Young announced her withdrawal from the group due to health reasons and the desire to further her education. Subsequently, two new members, Raina (레이나, real name Oh Hye Rin) and Nana (나나, real name Im Jin Ah) were added, making After School a 7-member group.

After School released their second EP on November 25, 2009, entitled "너 때문에" (Because of You). They made their comeback on the 27th on KBS's Music Bank with their title song 너 때문에. The song proved to be very popular, hitting #1 on various online charts as well as winning three Mutizen awards. A remix version of the single was released on January 22, 2010.

On March 25th, 2010, After School, with their new member Lizzy (리지, real name Park Soo Young) released their 3rd EP ("Bang!"). They had their comeback the next day, performing Let's Do It! and 뱅 (BANG)! on KBS's Music Bank. On December 31st, 2010, After School revealed that they were going to debut their ninth member Noh Lee Young, which is specialized on electric guitar and vocals, on KBS' Gayo Daejun, which during Bang!'s performance, she had a special guitar solo, officially becoming After School's ninth member, and announced their comeback as a nine member group with their first full-length album, VIRGIN, released on April 29, 2011.

On July 25th, 2011 After School (애프터스쿨) was divided into two sub-groups, After School RED (애프터스쿨 레드) and After School BLUE (애프터스쿨 블루). Both groups released a single and promoted their own songs at the same time. While A.S. BLUE (Jooyeon (주연), Raina (레이나), Lizzy (리지), and Lee Young (이영)) features an innocent concept, A.S.
