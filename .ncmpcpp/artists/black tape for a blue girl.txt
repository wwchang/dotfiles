Black Tape for a Blue Girl is an American act formed in 1986. Their music incorporates elements of dark cabaret, gothic, rock, ethereal, ambient and neo-classical music.

Fronted by Projekt Records' Sam Rosenthal, the band's lineup has changed significantly over time. The current lineup has Rosenthal on programming, guitar and keyboards, Brian Viglione (The Dresden Dolls) on percussion, guitar & bass, and vocalists Athan Maroulis (ex-Spahn Ranch), Laurie Reade (ex-Attrition) and Nicki Jaine. The most notable former members of the band are their long time vocalists, Oscar Herrera & Elysabeth Grant.  Former Cellist, Mera Roberts, is currently the lead singer/multi-instrumentalist for Mercurine and Oblivia.

The style of Black Tape for a Blue Girl is generally described as "gothic", though their long catalog of music does not often gel with all of the contemporary standards of gothic or darkwave music over time. The lyrics are by Rosenthal himself and explores powerful emotions of love, vulnerability, isolation, loss, jealousy, and passion.
