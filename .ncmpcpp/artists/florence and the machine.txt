Florence + The Machine (recording as Florence And The Machine) is the name of Florence Welch and a collaboration of other artists who provide backing music for her voice. Florence is an art college dropout from Camberwell, London, who was discovered singing Motown covers in a nightclub toilet, drunk. Musically Florence and the Machine's sound is generally referred to as soul-inspired indie rock.

Welch, who grew up listening to The White Stripes and Kate Bush, says she writes metaphorical songs that are "stories with consequences and weird morality issues." She gets her material from a variety of sources and experiences. Florence And The Machine's music has received praise across the British music media, especially from the BBC who have played a large part in their rise to prominence by bringing them into the spotlight as part of BBC Introducing. At the Brit Awards 2009 Florence picked up the Critics Choice Award; a category introduced in 2008 focusing on new talent, voted for by a panel of music industry experts.

The current line-up of the band consists of Robert Ackroyd (guitar), Christopher Lloyd Hayden (drums), Isabella Summers (keyboards) and Tom Monger (harp). Debut album, 'Lungs', was released in July 2009, preceded by third single, 'Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)'.
