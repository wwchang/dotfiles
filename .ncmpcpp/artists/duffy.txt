There are several artists who go by the name “Duffy”. The most notable of these is Welsh singer-songwriter Duffy (born Aimée Ann Duffy ).

1) ’60s-sounding Welsh blues singer Aimee Anne Duffy - known professionally as Duffy - released her debut single Rockferry in December 2007. After relocating to London in 2006, she came to the attention of Rough Trade. She is often compared to late ’60s soul diva Dusty Springfield and has experienced significant mainstream success with the single Mercy reaching #1 in the United Kingdom. The debut album was released in March 2008, and also made #1 on the UK album chart. Bernard Butler of Suede worked extensively on the album, lending it an authentic and wonderfully produced lush ’60s sound.

The 24-year-old’s debut album, Rockferry, triumphed at the recent BRIT Awards 2009 for British Album, British Female Solo Artist, and British Breakthrough Act.

2) Duffy is an American rock band stationed in Grand Rapids, MI. consisting of members Joe Girolamo (drums), Bill Kahler (piano), Eric Kehoe (guitar/vocals), and Joe Robert (bass). Their sound has been compared to ’60s greats such as Neil Young, The Beatles, and The Kinks, and also to current bands such as Wilco and Ryan Adams. Their first full length album, “Out of Doors,” was released in 2007 on the Green Room Group label. Duffy has since disbanded, with Kehoe joining the band Valentiger.

3) ‘Duffy’ was the alias used by British singer-songwriter Stephen Duffy during 1995-1998.

4) Duffy is a psychedelic/garage band from the ’60s whose song “Come Back, Come Back” appears on the Beyond The Calico Wall compilation. "Come Back Come Back" was produced by famed Nashville producer Buddy Killen, but with tons of tape flanging and echo, it is far more psychedelic than the average Killen production. The song was released by Atlantic Records subsidiary Dial, but quickly vanished, as did the band itself.

5) A pretty cool kid from the Melbourne region of Victoria, Australia. Most people call him Duffy, but his real name is Jordan. As Jordan has not yet released any music under the name “Duffy”, this is an incorrect tag for DJ Swe. Please do last.fm a favour and fix your tags.

6) Duffy is a hard rock band from UK, released in 1973 album called “Scruffy Duffy”.
