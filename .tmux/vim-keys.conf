## vim keys (from /usr/share/doc/tmux/examples/vim-keys.conf
##
## This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
## appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
## tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
## differently from the previous versions

## split windows like vim
## vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's
## Ctrl-b s/v h/j/k/l
bind s split-window -v
bind v split-window -h
bind c kill-pane

## move around panes with hjkl, as one would in vim after pressing ctrl-w
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R
# FIXME how to directly with Ctrl-h to switc, instead of Ctrl-b,Ctrl-h
#bind-key C-h select-pane -L
#bind-key C-j select-pane -D
#bind-key C-k select-pane -U
#bind-key C-l select-pane -R
#bind h resize-pane -L
#bind j resize-pane -D
#bind k resize-pane -U
#bind l resize-pane -R

## resize panes like vim
## feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
## one at a time can be slow
#bind < resize-pane -L 4 # left
#bind > resize-pane -R 4 # right
#bind - resize-pane -D 4 # down
#bind + resize-pane -U 4 # up

## bind : to command-prompt like vim
## this is the default in tmux already
bind : command-prompt

## vi-style controls for copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi
set -g status-keys vi
# setw -g mode-mouse on
