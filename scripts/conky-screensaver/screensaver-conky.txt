couldn't get a screenshot of my screensaver, but just imagine the coolest conky setup you can, but as a screensaver.
"conky-ss.desktop" in /usr/share/applications/screensavers/

i should cp .conkyrc into .conky-ss

that will run this next file.
"conky-ss" in /usr/lib/xscreensaver

#!/bin/bash
killall conky
conky -q -c /home/[user]/.conkyrc-ss

for some reason mine only works when i kill other conky's. trying to work around that. i'll share when i figure something out.
  it might have to do with them both drawing to the desktop instead of one (reg conky) being in a window..
  then finally ".conkyrc-ss" in your ~/

(here is about conkyrc not about screensaver-conky)

once you stick all the files in the places (don't forget to sudo it, and "chmod +x" the conky-ss file) then you should see it under your "Screensaver and Power management"
just thought i'd get this idea out there and let people play with it =]
