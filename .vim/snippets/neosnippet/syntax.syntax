#   catch /${1:pattern: empty, E484:, Vim(cmdname):{errmsg\\} optional}/
# <

# [ hard Tab ]
# If you use hard tab for indentation in snippet file, neosnippet will use
# 'shiftwidth' instead of Vim indent plugin. This feature is useful while some
# language's indent files can not work very well (e.g.: PHP, Python).
# >

#       if (${1:/* condition */}) {
